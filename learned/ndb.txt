Modeling one-to-many relationships

    Ancestor queries
        Strongly consistent
        1 write/sec

    KeyProperty
        High write throughput
        Eventual consistency

    StructuredProperty
        Can store child node directly in parent node
        Entity has max size of 1 MB which may be problematic (especially with repeated StructuredProperty)
